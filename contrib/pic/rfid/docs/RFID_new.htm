<body><pre>It consists of the following

Part	Description
2 off coded Key Fobs	Each FOB has a unique code
1 Program Disk 	Add or Erase FOB’s
1 Receiver Board	Including 125Khz Antenna + LED Pre-programed to accept FOBs supplied.

To use, Connect 12V to 14V as follows. 

With the 8 way connector facing you
Connect +12 V to top row 2nd pin from left and top row right hand pin.
Connect 0V to top row 3rd pin from left.

Outputs, A unique code is created on the 1st pin from left on the top row
when a valid Fob is present. 

Pin 2 of HEROS1 chip is normally 0V.
This will rise to +5V when a valid fob is placed near the Antenna. 

Also Pin 20 of UM3758 is normally 0V.
This will rise to +12V when a valid fob is placed near the Antenna.

Note, the LED will be permanently on



*********************** Modification 1 ***********************
Make LED come on only when a valid Fob is present

Cut track at point shown on diagram

Solder a wire as shown on diagram

Now the LED will light if a valid FOB is placed within 3” of Anntenna coil



*********************** Modification 2 ***********************

Drive 12V Relay, Solenoid or Door Mechanism

You will require the following additional components
1 Resistor     Suggest 1K 1/4W  
2 Diode        Suggest 1N4002
3 Transistor   Suggest BD237 (NPN) 

Connect Resistor from Pin 20 of UM3758 to Base of Transistor.
Connect Emmiter of Transistor to Ground
Connect Collector of Transistor to one end of Relay/Door Mechanism
Connect the other end of Relay/Door Mechanism to 12V
Connect the Diode across the Relay Cathode to +12V, Anode to Transistor Collector.

The above circuit has been tested with the BSTL 210 Door Mechanism
available from Gardiner Security (Price 9.75 +VAT)

Adding a Fob to Memory
1. Slowly pass Black Disk in front of Antenna, Then move away
2. Slowly pass new FOB in front of Antenna


Deleting All Fobs from memory
Place Black Disk in front of Antenna hold for 20 seconds, Then move away

Please note the different signals available.

Data
This is a unique serial code created when a Valid Key Fob is presented. The code is unique to the PCB. 
It is not related to the ID of the tag.
To make a Key Fob Valid it should be added to memory as explained in Adding a Fob to Memory.

RFID Data
This is the Data of the Key Fob. Each Key Fob will produce a different Data Code here.
Down load the <a href="http://home.btconnect.com/QTEKNOLOGY/rfid/H4102_C.pdf">EM H4102 Data sheet</a> for information on decoding this data.

TTL Output
This Output goes high only when a Valid Key Fob is near the Antenna.
To make a Key Fob Valid it should be added to memory as explained in Adding a Fob to Memory.
