Modtronix TCP/IP Stack
********************
The Modtronix TCP/IP Stack is a modified version of the original Micorchip TCP/IP Stack.
The licence of the original code still applies, see license.txt file!

********************
V2.43 Modtronix TCP/IP Stack - 2006 January 9 (cvs tag pic_mxmctcpip_v242)
********************
- Added support for PIC18F6627 CPU
- Implemented code required for second I2C module present on new PIC chips
- Added defines for Port F to compiler.h

********************
V2.42 Modtronix TCP/IP Stack - 2006 January 9 (cvs tag pic_mxmctcpip_v242)
********************
- Added UDPGetArray() and UDPPutArray() functions to improve performance
- Added TCPGetArray() and TCPPutArray() functions to improve performance
- Increased performance of UDP and TCP send and receive
- Added documentation and example projects for UDP, TCP, File System, Ticks...
- Fixed bug with second TICK
- Added memclr() function to helpers.c

********************
V2.41 Modtronix TCP/IP Stack - 2005 December 23 (cvs tag pic_mxmctcpip_v241)
********************
- Changed HTTP_INFO structure to allow implementation of more of the HTTP protocol
- Added support for HTTP POST method

********************
V2.40 Modtronix TCP/IP Stack - 2005 December 21 (cvs tag pic_mxmctcpip_v240)
********************
- Fixed error that occurred when long resource name is received in HTTP header
- Added support for Javascript ".js" files
- Fixed bug in HTTP module that overwrote memory when filenames longer then 12
  characters (8.3 format) were requested.
- Added HTTP_PARSE_FILETYPE_HTML and HTTP_PARSE_FILETYPE_JS defines to HTTP module that can
  be used to enable parsing (replace %nnn tags) of HTML and JavaScript files.
- Added support for sending compressed Text, HTML and JavaScript HTTP files.
- Added version information
- All IP messages now sent have the DF (Don't Fragment) flag set!
- File System has been completely redone. Now supports multiple File Systems
- Modified FTP code to use new File System
- Modified HTTP user authentication code
- Added new defines to optimize code for size or speed
- External EEPROM code completely redone. Put all I2C code in separate file.
- Tick code redone. Added support for 16bit and 8bit tick counters. This optimizes code size and speed.

********************
V2.30 Modtronix TCP/IP Stack - 2005 July 31 (cvs tag pic_mxmctcpip_v230)
********************
- Optimized CalcIPChecksum() function - smaller and faster
- Added option to use Access RAM in mac module to improve size and speed

********************
V2.20 Modtronix TCP/IP Stack - 2005 May 10 (cvs tag pic_mxmctcpip_v220)
********************
- Fixed problem in MAC Receive buffer where large TCP and UDP packets that crossed MAC
  Receive buffer boundary got corrupted.
- Fixed minimum length check in Ethernet packet - caused CRC error
- Added PIC configuration to main file - removed c18cfm.asm file
- Added configuration to mac.c to disable INT0 output of RTL8019AS. When disabled,
  PIC port pin RB0 is tri-state, and can be used by user.
- Modified TCPProcess() to include localIP as third param. This was done to
  allow this function to calculate checksum correctly.
- Added UDPChecksum logic in UDPProcess()
- Modified UDPProcess() and FindMatchingSocket() to include localIP as new parameter.
  This corrects pseudo header checksum logic in UDPProcess().
  It also corrects broadcast packet matching correct in FindMatchingSocket().
- Moved some defines from dhcp.h and dhcp.c to projdefs.h
- Moved some defines from ftp.h and ftp.c to projdefs.h
- Moved some defines from http.h and http.c to projdefs.h
- Moved some defines from ip.h and ip.c to projdefs.h
- Moved some defines from snmp.h and snmp.c to projdefs.h
- Moved some defines from tcp.h and tcp.c to projdefs.h

********************
V2.10 Modtronix TCP/IP Stack - 2005 March 01 (cvs tag pic_mxmctcpip_v210)
********************
- Cleaned up includes at top of each file. Each *.h file includes projdefs.h as first
  include. Each *.c file includes it's *.h file as first include.

********************
V2.00 Modtronix TCP/IP Stack - 2005 Jan 19 (cvs tag pic_mxmctcpip_v200)
********************
- Made major changes to the original stack. All project specific defines have been moved
  from stack files to the projdefs.h file
- Changed the callback functions HTTPGetVar() and HTTPExecGetCmd() in http module.
