@defgroup mod_tcpip_base_arp ARP
@ingroup mod_tcpip_base
The ARP layer of the Modtronix TCP/IP Stack is actually implemented by two modules: ARP and ARPTask.
ARP, implemented by the file "arp.c", creates the ARP primitives. ARPTask, implemented by the file
"arptsk.c", utilizes the primitives and provides complete ARP services.

ARPTask is implemented as a cooperative state machine, responding to ARP requests from the remote host.
It also maintains a one-level cache to store the ARP reply and returns to a higher level when the
appropriate calls are made. ARPTask does not implement a retry mechanism, so the upper level modules
or applications must detect time-out conditions and respond accordingly.

arptask operates in two modes: Server mode and Server/Client mode.
@li In Server/Client mode, a portion of code is enabled and compiled to generate ARP requests from the
local host itself.
@li In Server mode, the ARP request code is not compiled.

Usually, if the stack is used with server applications (such as HTTP Server or FTP serve)r, arptask should
be compiled in Server mode to reduce code size.

The compiler define STACK_CLIENT_MODE includes the client portion of code. In Server/Client mode, ARPTask
maintains a one-level cache to store the ARP reply from the remote host. When Server/Client mode is not
enabled, the cache is not defined and the corresponding RAM and program memory is not used.
