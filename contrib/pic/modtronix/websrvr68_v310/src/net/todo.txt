Modtronix TCP/IP Stack
********************
The Modtronix TCP/IP Stack is a modified version of the original Micorchip TCP/IP Stack.
The licence of the original code still applies!

Following is a list of items that will be improved in future versions of the stack.

- Implement debug output on com port that outputs screens in ANSI format. These debug
  sceens will display information about the current status of the TCP/IP stack. For
  example, the current state of all TCP sockets.

- Implement HTTP POST method.

- Implement more FTP functionality.

- Implement functions for sending Emails via stack.
