 * File History
 *
 * 2001-05-08, Nilesh Rajbharti:
 *    - Original Rev 1.0
 * 2002-05-22, Nilesh Rajbharti:
 *    - Rev 2.0 (See version.log for detail)
 * 2002-11-01, Nilesh Rajbharti:
 *    - Fixed TCPTick() SYN Retry bug.
 * 2002-12-05, Nilesh Rajbharti:
 *    - Modified TCPProcess() to include localIp as third param.
 *      This was done to allow this function to calculate checksum correctly.
 * 2005-09-01, David Hosken (DH):
 *    - Created documentation for existing code
 * 2005-11-23, David Hosken (DH):
 *    - Added "ps->startTick = TickGet();" line to end of TCPConnect() function.
 * 2006-05-03, David Hosken (DH):
 *    - Added logic for new bACKValid flag. Got this fix from new Microchip V3.02 stack!
 *    - Fixed bug with ACK and SEQ numbers
 * 2006-09-06, David Hosken (DH):
 *    - Replaced lots of code with code from new Microchip TCP/IP V3.75
 * 2006-09-08, David Hosken (DH): Implemented changes from Microchip TCP/IP stack 3.75
