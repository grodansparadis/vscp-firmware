 * File History
 *
 * 2005-12-21, David Hosken (DH):
 *    - Tick code redone. Added support for 16bit and 8bit tick counters.
 *      This optimizes code size and speed.
 * 2005-09-01, David Hosken (DH):
 *    - Created documentation for existing code
 * 2002-12-05, Nilesh Rajbharti:
 *    - Modified TCPProcess() to include localIP as third param.
 *      This was done to allow this function to calculate checksum correctly.
 * 2002-11-01, Nilesh Rajbharti:
 *    - Fixed TCPTick() SYN Retry bug.
 * 2002-05-22, Nilesh Rajbharti:
 *    - Rev 2.0 (See version.log for detail)
 * 2001-05-08, Nilesh Rajbharti:
 *    - Original Rev 1.0
