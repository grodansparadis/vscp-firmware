// DHCP - documentation module
/**
@defgroup mod_tcpip_user_dhcp DHCP
@ingroup mod_tcpip_user

The DHCP layer of the Modtronix TCP/IP stack is implemented by the
file "dhcp.c". The header file "dhcp.h" defines the services provided
by the layer. DHCP is an active layer that broadcasts DHCP requests
and automatically receives and decodes DHCP responses. Its main
features include: 
@li Configuration of the IP and gateway addresses and subnet mask
@li Automatic DHCP lease time and lease renewal management
@li Fully automatic operation without user application intervention

The DHCP module is implemented as a cooperative task, performing
automatic operations without the knowledge of the main
application. The actual DHCP integration and control is done by the
Stack Manager; it handles all required operations as part of its
standard task, using the DHCP APIs to control the module∆s
behavior. The user does not need to know about DHCP in order to use
it.

A user application may also choose to call some of the APIs to
directly control DHCP operation, such as whether DHCP is configured or
not, and whether to permanently stop DHCP. Normally, the user's
application should not need to directly interact with DHCP at all. To
use the DHCP module, the user project files must be modified as
follows: @li Uncomment STACK_USE_DHCP in the header file "StackTsk.h".
@li Include the "dhcp.c" and "udp.c" files in the project.  @li
Increase MAX_UDP_SOCKETS by one (at least one UDP socket must be
available for DCHP; adjust the numbers of sockets based on UDP and
DCHP needs).

When DHCP is implemented, the user application must not attempt
network communications until DHCP is configured properly. Normally, if
a user application contains one or more client applications that
require communications on power-up or RESET, the application must
check that DHCP is configured before transmitting any data using the
lower layer modules. This can be done with the function DHCPIsBound()

The official DHCP specification (RFC1541) requires the DHCP client to
renew its IP configuration before its lease time expires. To track
lease time, the user application must make sure that TickUpdate() is
called as required, and that reasonable time accuracy is maintained
(refer to the source code file "websrvr.c" for a working example). The
time resolution required is 15 minutes, plus or minus, which means
that TickUpdate() may be called at a very low priority.

For the DHCP module to automatically configure the addresses and
subnet mask, there must be at least one DHCP server on the network. It
is the user∆s responsibility to implement some method for "publishing"
the configurations back to potential users. Options range from
manually reading the information from a display on each node, to
storing the information in a central server. DHCP updates the values
of MY_IP_BYTE?, MY_GATE_BYTE? and MY_MASK_BYTE? as a result of
automatic configuration.
