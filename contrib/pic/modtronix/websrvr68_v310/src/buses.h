 /**
 * @defgroup mod_buses Serial Buses
 *
 * The @appname implements many different serial buses that can be linked together via the web
 * based interface. For example, USART 1 (RS232 port) can be linked to a UDP port to implement a
 * USART to UDP interface converters.
 * The following buses are currently implemented:
 * - Serial 1 bus, is available via the 3 pin serial connector on the board. This bus is
 *   connected to USART1 of the PIC chip, and can be configured for RS-232 or 5V TTL voltage levels.
 * - Serial 2 bus, is available via the daughter board connector. This bus is connected to the
 *   USART of the PIC chip, and has 5V TTL voltage levels.
 * - UDP Port 1, has a default port address of 54124
 * - UDP Port 2, has a default port address of 54125
 * - One master I2C buses. This bus is configured for 400kbit/sec. It available via the red
 *   MicroMatch connector on the @boardname. It can only be used in Master Mode.
 * - One master SPI port. This is a software SPI port. It consists of 4 signals, SDO (Data Out),
 *   SDI (Data In), CLK (clock) and CS (chip Select). These 4 pins have 5V TTL levels, and can be
 *   configured via the web page.
