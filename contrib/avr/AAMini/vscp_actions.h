 * goal is to implement a small module for home automation including:
 * - 8 input (on/off)
 * - 8 output (on/off)
 * - IR capable receiver
 * - piezzo buzzer
 * - a number of analog input (temperature / light / ...)
 * - bootloader support
 *
 * none of these goals are implemented yet!
 * hardware supported:
