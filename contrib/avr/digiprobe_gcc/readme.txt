This project runs on a tiny PCB consisting of AT90CANxxx and
MAX3051 CAN transceiver.

That PCB also carries the nice MCP3550 22-Bit ADC with precision
current preamplifier for low currents (µA...pA configurable per resistor),
high quality reference for ADC and LM60 temperature sensor for compensation.

It builds fine with WinAVR (Versions 2010) and also with
AvrStudio 4.18 and later.
