********************************************************************************
V2.45Beta1 Modtronix TCP/IP Stack - 2006 September 6 (cvs tag pic_mxmctcpip_v245b1)
********************************************************************************
- Implemented code modification to TCP code from Microchip V3.75 and V3.60 TCP/IP stack:
- Changes ported from Microchip V3.75:
     - Added beta DNS client module (DNS.c).  DHCP was also updated to obtain a DNS 
       server address.  Added AppConfig.PrimaryDNSServer IP address.  Added STACK_USE_DNS 
       configuration macro.  To use the DNS client, call DNSResolve() with the server name, 
       ex: DNSResolve("www.microchip.com"), and then periodically call DNSIsResolved() 
       until it returns TRUE, ex: DNSIsResolved(&IPAddressDestination).  Only one DNS 
       resolution can be in progress at a time.  Because the DNS client is a beta module, 
       the API or code may change before being finalized.  No formal DNS API documentation 
       is available yet.
     - Added beta NetBIOS Name Service responder module (NBNS.c).  Added 
       AppConfig.NetBIOSName string.  Added STACK_USE_NBNS configuration macro.  Added 
       MY_DEFAULT_HOST_NAME macro in StackTsk.h.  Now, whenever a NetBIOS broadcast 
       attempting to resolve AppConfig.NetBIOSName arrives, a response will be made.  
       This form of name resolution only works on a single subnet.  Off the subnet, 
       manual registration in a DNS server or other means will be needed to allow the 
       local Host Name to be recognized and translated to an IP address.  The default 
       NetBIOS name for the board is "MCHPBOARD".  To test the NetBIOS Name Service 
       module, try entering http://MCHPBOARD/ into your web browser instead of the board's
       IP address.
     - Added Embedded Ethernet Device Discoverer PC project to aid in embedded product 
       discovery when connected to a network and demonstrate how to write PC applications 
       which can communicate with embedded devices.  The source code for this device is 
       included.  It can be built using the Microsoft Visual C# 2005 Express Edition 
       compiler.  At the time of stack release, this 3rd party PC development tool can be 
       downloaded at no cost from http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/.  If using 
       only the Microchip Device Discoverer executable file without the Visual C# compiler, 
       the .NET Framework 2.0 must be installed on the local PC.  The application setup 
       utility should allow dynamic downloading of this component if the target machine 
       does not already have it installed.
    -  Updated Announce.c to listen and respond to discovery requests sent to UDP port 
       30303 starting with the character 'D'.  To test this functionality, use the 
       Embedded Ethernet Device Discoverer on a PC connected to the same subnet.
    -  All stack modules that can be disabled (DHCP.c, FTP.c, etc) now will no longer 
       emit a compiler error if you have it in the project without defining the 
       appropriate macro (STACK_USE_DHCP, STACK_USE_FTP, etc).  It will simply generate 
       no machine code when compiled and the stack will not use that module.  Make sure 
       the proper macro is defined for each module that you wish to use.
    -  Added SetRXHashTableEntry() to ENC28J60.c.  This function can be used to set the 
       appropriate bit in the Hash Table registers to join a particular multicast group.
    -  Added Realtek RTL8019AS Ethernet controller support to the stack.  MAC.c was 
       renamed to RTL8019AS.c.  This Ethernet controller is not recommended for new 
       designs.  RTL8019AS support was reintroduced to provide ongoing assistance to 
       former Application designs implementing this chip.  For new applications, use the 
       Microchip ENC28J60 or PIC18F97J60 family of microcontrollers.
- Bug Fixes ported from Microchip V3.75:
    -  Fixed a serious MAC TXBuffer leak in TCP.c.  Previously TCP.c would allocate a 
       buffer for each socket in use, but under heavy traffic conditions (ex: user holds 
       down F5 on web browser), the buffer handle might have been discarded before 
       releasing the buffer.  As a result all TCP connections would have lost the ability 
       to send any application data after the TXBuffer pool ran out.
    -  In the TCP_SYN_SENT TCP state, ACKs may only be received (as opposed to SYN+ACK 
       packets) if the remote node thinks the connection is already open.  A RST is now 
       sent in response to an unexpected ACK, which may improve reconnection time when 
       this (rare) condition occurs.
    -  A bug was present in the UDP module where remote MAC addresses would be cached for 
       each socket, even when UDPInit() or UDPClose() was called, or the microcontroller 
       was reset.  As a result, responses to incoming packets could have been sent to the 
       wrong MAC address.  UDP Sockets are now properly initialized/closed.
- Changes ported from Microchip V3.60:
    -  Changed IP Gleaning procedure.  Now, if DHCP is enabled, the DHCP module will 
       continue to look for a new IP address/renew existing IP address if the IP address 
       is configured using IP Gleaning.  Previously, the DHCP module would be disabled 
       once a successful ICMP packet was received and used to configure the IP address.
    -  Updated TCP state machine.  It now includes the TCP_FIN_WAIT_2 state.  Some other 
       changes were made to handle errors more robustly.
    -  FTP client hash printing has been added to the FTP server.  Now, whenever a chunk 
       of data is successfully uploaded to the device, a '#' character will appear on the 
       FTP client screen.  The numbers of bytes each '#' represents is variable.
    -  Multiple TX buffer support has been implemented.  Most stack layers have been 
       touched.  ENC28J60.c has the most extensive changes.  Each socket may use only one
       TX buffer.
    -  Implemented TCP retransmission support regardless of if TCP_NO_WAIT_FOR_ACK is 
       defined or not.
    -  TCP_NO_WAIT_FOR_ACK in StackTsk.h has been undefined by default.  This should 
       increase default TCP connection robustness.  Packets sent from the stack to the 
       remote node will now be detected and retransmitted if lost or corrupted.
    -  All TCP packets are now retransmitted immediately after being initially transmitted 
       when TCP_NO_WAIT_FOR_ACK is undefined.  This improves throughput greatly when 
       communicating with systems which wait a long time before transmitting ACKs.  TCP/IP 
       stacks, such as that used by Microsoft Windows, implement the TCP Delayed 
       Acknowledgement algorithm, which is why this retransmission is necessary for high 
       performance.  The double transmission feature can be disabled in the Microchip 
       TCP/IP stack by defining "DEBUG" either in the TCP.c file or the project compiler 
       macros section.  Using DEBUG mode can be useful when trying to look for errors 
       using Ethreal [ http://www.ethereal/ ].
    -  Lowered TCP_START_TIMEOUT_VAL from 60 seconds to 3 seconds.  60 seconds is an 
       unreasonably long timeout for modern day network speeds.
    -  Native support for the SLIP module has been dropped.
- Fixes ported from Microchip V3.60:
    -  DHCP client will now correctly use the first DHCP offer received when connected 
       to a network running multiple DHCP servers.  Previously, the board would get no
       IP address when attached to a network with multiple DHCP servers (unless the DHCP 
       request was transmitted before a second DHCP offer was received -- a relatively 
       rare event).  Additionally, DHCPLeaseTime does not get reset to 60 seconds or 
       the value stored in the last DHCP packet received prior to receiving the ACK.
    -  UDPProces() will now correctly process received UDP packets that have a 0x0000 
       checksum field.  The UDP protocol specifies that 0x0000 means the checksum is 
       disabled.  Packets with a 0x0000 checksum were previously thrown away unless the 
       calculated checksum also happened to be 0x0000.
    -  The TCPIsPutReady() function will now honor the remote node's TCP window size.  In 
       other words, if the remote application pauses or cannot handle the incoming data 
       rate, the TCP flow control feature will correctly function.  Previously, if the 
       remote node ran out of incoming buffer memory, the TCP layer would still allow 
       more data to be transmitted.  This would result in the loss or corruption of 
       application data, with a potentially broken connection.  The change requires 2 more
       bytes of RAM per TCP socket (TCB array).
