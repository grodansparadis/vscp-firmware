*       UDP example program.
*
* This example program shows how to receive UDP datagrams. This program
* acts as the server, and listens for any data entering on UDP port 54123.
* If a UDP message is received, we set the system LED if the first byte of
* the received message '1', and clear the system LED if it is '0'
*
* The following modules included in this project:
* - ARP
* - ICMP
* - IP
* - UDP
