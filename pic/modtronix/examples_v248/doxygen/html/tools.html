MPLAB C18 Compiler</a></h2>
The MPLAB C18 compiler is a C compiler for the PIC18 family of PIC microcontrollers from <a href="http://www.microchip.com" target="_blank">www.microchip.com</a>. A <b>free</b> student version can be downloaded from their site. Go to <a href="http://www.microchip.com" target="_blank">www.microchip.com</a>, click on the "Development Tools" link and look for the MPLAB C18 compiler link. The free version creates a bit larger code, but apart from that is a fully functional compiler! The Modtronix TCP/IP Stack can be compiled with the free version!<p>
All MPLAB project included with source code downloads have been configured for when the MPLAB C18 C compiler is on the c drive in a folder named "mcc18". If this is not the case, the user will have to:<ul>
<li>Modify the paths in the MPLAB project. Right click on the MPLAB project in the "Project" window in MPLAB, select "Build Options" from the context menu, and update the paths.</li><li>Modify the Language tool locations in MPLAB. Select "Set Language Tool Locations" from the "Project" menu in MPLAB. Update the paths for the MPLAB C18 compiler.</li></ul>

Modtronix Network Bootloader</a></h2>
The Modtronix Network Bootloader application is a user friendly program that is used to:<ul>
<li>Update the firmware on the target board</li><li>Update the web pages on the target board</li></ul>
<p>
For the latest version of the Modtronix Network Bootloader, documentation and screen shots, please go to <a href="http://www.modtronix.com/soft/netloader" target="_blank">www.modtronix.com/soft/netloader</a>.<h3><a class="anchor" name="tools_mxbootloader_firmware">
Updating the firmware</a></h3>
No PIC programmer is required. The Modtronix Ethernet enabled target board used must have a bootloader installed on it. Such a board can be identified by a BLN Vm.nn label on the front of the board - normally stuck on the RTL8019AS 100 pin network chip. Where Vm.nn is the version number of the bootloader.<h3><a class="anchor" name="tools_mxbootloader_webpages">
Updating the Web pages</a></h3>
The Modtronix Network Bootloader is also used to compile and upload Web pages to the target Ethernet board. This is a simple two stage process, and is done by clicking the "Compile" and "Upload Web Pages" buttons. Before web pages can be uploaded, they have to be compiled to a <em>File System Image</em>. A <em>File System Image</em> is a single file that contains the entire file system that is present on the target board. After compiling the standard web pages to a <em>File System Image</em>, they are uploaded to the target Ethernet board.<p>

Modtronix Embedded Debugger</a></h2>
The Modtronix Embedded Debugger is an utility for displaying debug information generated by an embedded board. Currently it only supports RS232 communication. The embedded board will generate "debug messages", and write it out via its RS232 port. This debug information will consist out of a "debug code", "message code" and optional "message parameters". On receiving the debug information, the Modtronix Embedded Debugger will look up the message assigned to the received "message code" in the project files, and display it in the Debug Tab indicated by the received "debug code". Using this method to output debug information means that the embedded board only needs to send a short message (typically two bytes long) for a detailed debug message to be displayed. This saves both code space in the embedded board's CPU, and requires less time to send the message.<p>
