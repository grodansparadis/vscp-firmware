 * Function:        BOOL FTPVerify(char *login, char *password)
 *
 * PreCondition:    None
 *
 * Input:           login       - Telnet User login name
 *                  password    - Telnet User password
 *
 * Output:          TRUE if login and password verfies
 *                  FALSE if login and password does not match.
 *
 * Side Effects:    None
 *
 * Overview:        Compare given login and password with internal
 *                  values and return TRUE or FALSE.
 *
 * Note:            This is a callback from Telnet Server to
 *                  user application.  User application must
 *                  implement this function in his/her source file
 *                  return correct response based on internal
 *                  login and password information.

 *                  this function repeatdly to ensure all open
 *                  or new connections are served on time.
